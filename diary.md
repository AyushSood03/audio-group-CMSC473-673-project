Xinchen Yu: Setting up environment for audio captioning model
Dat Dao: Setting up image captioning model.

Xinchen Yu: API is not a good choice because queue is long. Seems like other users are doing their research. Trying to implement the model locally. For Nexus Pytorch implementation, a missing package may block the usage.

Xinchen Yu: Doing conda setups.
Dat Dao: Setup env on the server + Research on the recent model for Image Captioning (pixtral/molmo)

Xinchen Yu: It seems like conda virtual environment is constructed successfully. The API for LTU-AS works, trying to do the local inference. Need to find a way to convert sample rate to 16khz. Then cross-validation methods.
