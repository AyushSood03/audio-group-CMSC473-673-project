Due to the file size limitation, I cannot upload everything here.
Please first go to https://github.com/Aldenhovel/bleu-rouge-meteor-cider-spice-eval4imagecaption/tree/main to download the code.

pip install pycocoevalcap
python main.py

The input filfe should be in the same format as "captions_example.json" and "references_example.json" in example folder.
For readability I took part of the data in these two example and constructed two smaller file.

captions_format_example.json
references_format_example.json

Format our text in this way should be enough for the evaluation to run.
