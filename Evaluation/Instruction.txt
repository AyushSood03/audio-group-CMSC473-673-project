pip install pycocoevalcap
python main.py



The following two file shows the format of input file into main.py
The input filfe should be in the same format as "captions_example.json" and "references_example.json"
For readability I took part of the data in these two example and constructed two smaller file.

captions_format_example.json
references_format_example.json

Format our text in this way should be enough for the evaluation to run.
